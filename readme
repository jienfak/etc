Environment installation files and scripts for it.
To install run:
	$ ./configure.sh
After it config and dot files will be linked, so changing them the way like:
	$ vi $HOME/.profile
will affect in this git repository so you can commit it and save.

The structure is supposed to be as simple as possible and scripts should be small.

# configure.d/dot.sh
"dot/*" files are linked into $HOME directory with '.' character concatenated in front.

# configure.d/config.sh
"config/*" files arel linked with the same name into $XDG_CONFIG_DIR.

# configure.d/inferno.sh
Creates directory $INFRENO/usr/$USER and links inferno/lib into it.

# ... (I will describe it later if there will be need about it)

If some variables aren't set then script isn about to do nothing.
It's so to make environment setting painless.
